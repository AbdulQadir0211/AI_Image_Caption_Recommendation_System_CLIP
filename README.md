# AI Image Caption Recommender System with CLIP

This project is an AI-powered image caption recommender system built using OpenAI's CLIP model. It recommends captions for social media posts (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) by finding the most relevant captions from a curated list based on the uploaded image.

---

## Problem Statement
Social media users often struggle to come up with engaging captions for their posts. This project solves that problem by automatically recommending captions that best match an uploaded image, helping users enhance their social media presence effortlessly.

---

## Features
- Upload images via a web interface.
- Generate image embeddings using CLIP.
- Match images to relevant captions from a predefined list.
- Display top 5 most relevant captions with similarity scores.
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
